# TestBench MRuby <-> Ruby Compatibility

## Installation

MRuby compilation is controlled by `build_config.rb`. Copy `build_config.rb.example` to `build_config.rb`

    cp build_config.rb.example build_config.rb

The example file should suffice for getting started. For more information, see the [MRuby documentation](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/blob/master/doc/guides/compile.md)

Compile MRuby with `mruby-local` (it will download the [MRuby source code](https://github.com/mruby/mruby) the first time it is run):

    ./compile-mruby.sh

The compilation step produces executable files that get placed in `./bin`. Either add `bin` to `$PATH`, or else copy these files to a directory already in `$PATH`.

Test the `bench-mruby` executable by running it:

    > ./bin/bench-mruby
    Running test/automated/example.rb
    MRuby
      TestBench
        Constant is defined

    Finished running 1 file
    Ran 1 test in 0.001s (1000.0 tests/second)
    1 passed, 0 skipped, 0 failed, 0 total errors

The `mruby-require` executable can be used to run a single test file, similar to `ruby test/automated/some_file.rb`. Do not use the `mruby` executable itself in this manner, as it does not work with the `require` implementation provided by this project. Test `mruby-require`:

    > ./bin/mruby-require test/automated/example.rb
    Running test/automated/example.rb
    MRuby
      TestBench
        Constant is defined

## Testing Ruby Projects With bench-mruby

A typical TestBench project will install gem dependencies locally under e.g. `./gems`, which are loaded in development via `init.rb`. Projects that follow this structure can be tested with `bench-mruby` (as well as `mruby-require` for running single files). The following example assumes that the executables compiled previously are available in the shell's executable path.

    > cd /path/to/project

    # Install gem dependencies
    > ./install-gems.sh

    # Run the test suite normally with Ruby
    > ruby test/automated.rb

    # Run the test suite with MRuby
    > bench-mruby test/automated.rb

    # Run a single file with MRuby
    > mruby-require test/automated/some_test.rb

## Adding MRuby Support to an Existing Project

If the project structure resembles a typical TestBench project, the three principal reasons it might not already be compatible with TestBench's MRuby support are:

1. The project depends on parts of Ruby or the Ruby standard library that aren't compiled in to MRuby
2. Some of the Ruby code in the project (or its gem dependencies) isn't compatible with TestBench's MRuby support

Generally, the first issue is resolved by including additional MRuby gems (called "mrbgems") in `build_config.rb`. See the [MRuby documentation](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/blob/master/doc/guides/mrbgems.md) for more information.

The second issue is less straightforward to resolve. However, since all of the libraries that comprise the [Eventide Toolkit](https://eventide-project.org) use TestBench, work is already underway to ensure they are available and compatible with TestBench's MRuby support. Although the toolkit is aimed at evented microservices development, it also contains many underlying libraries that are useful to any Rubyist.

## Incompatibilities / Notes

### Object / Kernel

- **method_missing** - `respond_to?` on MRuby always returns true, versus MRI, which only returns true if `method_missing` is implemented on the class

- **defined?** - `defined?` does not work on mruby, which means e.g. `defined?(Foo::Bar)` must be written as `Object.const_defined?(:Foo) && Foo.const_defined?(:Bar)`

- **Heredoc** - Heredoc support in mruby is limited to `<<TEXT`; `<<~TEXT` is not supported

- **Exit** Kernel's `#exit` in MRuby does not raise a SystemExit exception, `raise SystemExit.new(1)` must be used

- **Warn** Kernel's `#warn` is not available in MRuby without introducing a backfill

### Exceptions

- **Backtrace locations** - In MRI, both call stacks and backtraces (which are just call stacks stored in an exception) come in two variants, `caller`/`backtrace` (which return an array of strings) and `caller_locations`/`backtrace_locations` (which return an array of `Thread::Backtrace::Location` objects). MRuby only has `caller` and `backtrace`, not `caller_locations` and `backtrace_locations`

### Time

- **Time.new** - The final two arguments to `Time.new` differ between MRI and mruby:
  - In MRI, the penultimate argument is a decimal value for seconds (e.g. `1.11` means one second and 11 milliseconds), and the final argument is the time zone offset.
  - In mruby, the penultimate argument is an integer value for seconds, and the final argument is an integer value for the number of microseconds. In the above example of `1.11`, you'd pass `1` and `110000` as the final two arguments to mruby.
- **iso8601** - only UTC timestamps are possible, because MRuby's Time class cannot return the local offset, e.g. `-06:00` for GMT-6. The implementation of iso8601 in this project converts local times to UTC

### Struct

- **Struct instance variables** - Struct classes cannot have attributes like `attr_accessor`, since mruby does not allow instance variables on core classes.

### Array

- **Array * method** In MRI, `Array#*` is a multi purpose method: `[0] * 3` is `[0, 0, 0]`, and `['a', 'b', 'c'] * '+'` is `"a+b+c"`. The method isn't in MRuby, and backfilling support would be more trouble than it's worth, as all the different purposes of the method would have to be ported.

### Symbol

- **String methods** Even with `mruby-symbol-ext` compiled in to MRuby, Symbol does not support all the string methods under MRuby that it does under MRI.

### File / IO

- **Pathname** MRI's `pathname` library has no equivalent in MRuby

### Thread

- While there is limited support for threads via the [mruby-thread](https://github.com/mattn/mruby-thread) MRuby gem, MRuby has no GVL, and thus cannot support multiple threads sharing the same interpreter.
- Native threads / actors are still possible with the [ZeroMQ MRuby gem](https://github.com/zeromq/mruby-zmq)

### Other Standard Libraries

- **requiring** - The mruby equivalent of Ruby's standard libraries cannot be required; they must be compiled in to mruby itself. This means e.g. `require 'json'` must be "guarded" by a check for mruby, e.g. `require 'json' unless RUBY_ENGINE == 'mruby'`. This also applies to `require 'test_bench'` and `require 'test_bench/fixture'`, as they are compiled in to MRuby, too.

- **Tempfile directory** Tempfiles in MRuby must have a directory specified when a filename is given. Supplying a directory in this case doesn't cause a problem for MRI
